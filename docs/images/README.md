# Diagram Resources

This directory contains diagram resources for the LLM Privacy Layer project.

## Mermaid Diagram

The file `privacy_layer_flow.mmd` contains a [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) diagram definition that shows the flow of data through the privacy layer. You can use this in several ways:

### Viewing the Diagram

1. **GitHub Rendering**: If you're using GitHub, the `.mmd` file should render directly when viewed in the repository.

2. **Mermaid Live Editor**: Copy and paste the contents of the `.mmd` file into the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) for viewing and editing.

3. **VS Code**: If you're using VS Code, you can install the "Mermaid Preview" extension to view the diagram directly in your editor.

### Generating an Image

To generate a PNG or SVG image from the Mermaid diagram:

1. Open the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
2. Paste the contents of the `.mmd` file
3. Use the "Export" button to save as PNG or SVG
4. Save the file as `privacy_layer_flow.png` or `privacy_layer_flow.svg` in this directory

### Modifying the Diagram

The diagram is designed to show how data flows through the privacy layer system. If you need to modify it:

1. Edit the `.mmd` file directly
2. Use the Mermaid Live Editor to preview your changes
3. Update the PNG/SVG if you're using static images

## Placeholder File

The file `privacy_layer_flow.png` is currently a placeholder. Replace it with an actual image generated from the Mermaid diagram for inclusion in the main README.
